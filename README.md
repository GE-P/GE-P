I'm a DevOps enthusiast and a hobbyist app creator. Over the years, I've honed my skills in automating solutions to accelerate processes on the DevOps side. Simultaneously, I've explored my creativity and curiosity by crafting various apps and scripts, dividing my creations into two categories.

### ðŸ”§ **DevOps Creations**: 

I'm passionate about automating solutions, optimizing workflows, and enhancing efficiency in the workplace. This side of my work revolves around DevOps practices. Some of those :

- [Gitlab CI-CD Variables Setup](https://github.com/GE-P/Gitlab-CI-Variables-Setup): Python script for managing environment variables in a GitLab project.
- [Gitlab Convention Verifier](https://github.com/GE-P/Gitlab-Convention-Verifier): Script used to verify and correct naming and structure conventions for Gitlab projects and groups.
- [Gitlab Default Branch Configurator](https://github.com/GE-P/Gitlab-Default-Branch-Configurator): Script designed to automate the branches defaults configurations in Gitlab projects.
- [Hooks-For-Devs](https://github.com/GE-P/Git-Hooks-For-Devs): Hooks for Gitlab and Github for commits naming convention inspection.

### ðŸš€ **Creative Ventures**: 

On the other front, I embark on journeys of creativity and curiosity. I've delved into concepts such as machine learning, mobile game development, and other fascinating domains. Some of those :

- [Wine Prices Prediction](https://github.com/GE-P/Wine-Price-Prediction): Web Application to forecast wines future prices with a linear regression algorithm.
- [Weather Forecast App](https://github.com/GE-P/Weather-Forecast-App): A weather forecast app made in java for android platforms.
- [Bomberman](https://github.com/GE-P/Bomberman): Bomberman game remake in C17, SDL2 and with networking.
- [RSS Feed Page](https://github.com/GE-P/RSS-Feed-Page): Personnal web page to receive RSS feeds from a website to watch tech related informations.

### ðŸ”¨ **Languages and Tools**:

- Terraform
- Ansible
- Gitlab CI-CD
- Docker
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- Bash and Powershell
